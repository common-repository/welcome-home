== Description ==

THE SYRIAN WAR HAS FORCED 12 MILLION PEOPLE TO FLEE THEIR HOMES.
PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE OPENED UP THEIR HOMES AND THEIR HEARTS TO SHELTER THE REFUGEES.
AND NOW IS THE MOMENT THAT THE INTERNET CAN ALSO OPEN UP ITS DOORS IN ORDER TO HELP.

Welcome Home is an initiative from ACNUR Comité Español, focused on the objective of helping the refugees through an online collaboration.

After over 4 years of war in Syria, millions of people have been forced to leave their homes in search of safety in other countries. We are living through one of the most serious humanitarian crises of our times.

Governments and citizens all over the world are showing their solidarity and have opened their borders and their homes to shelter the refugees. Their needs don't stop there and more help is needed.

This is why ACNUR Comité Español has created Welcome Home, a project that uses the Internet's potential to get immediate publicity and help. Using a code, any blog or website will be able to offer their homepage to spread news and encourage helping the refugees. Every time someone visits an associated site, they will have direct access to make a donation and to join the initiative.

This way, any website can collaborate and become a gateway to help over 12 million refugees.
